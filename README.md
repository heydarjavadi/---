# botnet-detection-project
this is my bachelor project
-Today, botnets as the greatest opportunity for cybercriminals and considered the biggest challenge for security researchers.
Botnet is a collection of infected computers that have been scattered across the network and guided by the bot_master.
An attacker could infect systems without informing the owners of the resources they served to advance the nonproliferation such as distributed attacks, information theft and spamming.
Bot networks to delay the discovery and its maintenance has many ways one of the most important techniques, domain and IP flux techniques that are associated with the DNS server is used.
The project seeks to design and implement systems to detect suspicious domains by considering the scope and IP flux techniques used by bot networks.
